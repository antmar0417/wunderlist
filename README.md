# Code Review

Code review written by [Sofia Rönnkvist](https://github.com/sofiaronnkvist).

1. `users/register.php:11` - You should make sure that the user chooses a strong password, at least 16 characters.
2. `users/avatar/upload.php:13` - Your folder uploads can't be found, and isn't created when a new avatar is uploaded.
3. `index.php:general` - A back button of some sorts would be nice, so you don't have to push X every time you want to go back.
4. `users/register.php` - You only have to validate data at this stage, not sanitize it.
5. `users/register.php` - If you have unique fields in your database, like email, you need to handle if someone tries to create a new account with an already existing email.
6. `/app/users/email/upload.php` - Same thing here, if I try to update to an email that already exists I should be notified.
7. `functions.php:22` - This function could be written as return isset($\_SESSION['user']);, since it's set to return a bool.
8. `header.php:10` - Nice job styling using some Bootstrap!
9. `General` - Even though FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is supposed to be deprecated, htmlspecialchars doesn't seem to sanitize output like for example a simple script the same way.
10. `users/lists/delete-list.php` - You should always use bindParam instead of putting variables directly in your query. And here, since you've not prepared a queary, you don't need to run execute.
